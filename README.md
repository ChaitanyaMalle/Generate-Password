# Generate-Password
This code offers a customizable password generator. 
It allows users to specify how many passwords they want and the desired length for each password (with a minimum enforced length).
The generated passwords are guaranteed to include lowercase letters, and the functions replaceWithNumber and replaceWithUppercaseLetter introduce some randomness by inserting digits and uppercase letters at random positions within the password.
